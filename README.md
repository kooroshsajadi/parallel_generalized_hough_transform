# Generalized Hough Transform Performance Comparison in Serial and Parallel
In this project, we are comparing the performance of the Generalized Hough Transform (GHT) algorithm in serial and parallel (using MPI).
The original code from the author is presereved so for further work on the project, the Cuda implementation will also be applied.

This repository is under development.

## Procedure
 The first phase involves preprocessing the input image and template image, including steps like edge detection and gradient calculation, which are key to the GHT process.
